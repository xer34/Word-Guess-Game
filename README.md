Coding Bootcamp HW3 by Alexander Lewis

Word Guess Game is a hangman style word guessing game in which the user attempts to guess the word chosen by the computer. The game is video game themed.

This game is useful to learn the principals of javascript arrays, functions, statements, and loops. It is also useful to begin learning about the power of objects.
